### How it Works
- **Session Token Code**: The app generates a Nitnendo login url and after the user logins it redirects to a link containing the Session Token Code.
- **Session Token**: The app sends a request to Nintendo with the Session Token Code to get the Session Token 
- **Iksm token**: The app sends a request to flapg server with the Session Token to get the f flag required for Nintendo's Web Service endpoint. This returns the Iksm token. The Iksm token is placed in BrowserWindow cookies and is the only value required to access SplatNet.
- Once we have the Session Token, we can refresh the Iksm token without further logins.
